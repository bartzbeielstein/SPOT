Description: A set of tools for model based optimization and tuning of
    algorithms. It includes surrogate models, optimizers and design of experiment
    approaches. The main interface is spot, which uses sequentially updated
    surrogate models for the purpose of efficient optimization. The main goal is
    to ease the burden of objective function evaluations, when a single evaluation
    requires a significant amount of resources.
